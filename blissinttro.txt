Welcome to the world of digital harmony! This project introduces Bliss, a dynamic web-based music player with playlist functionality and an innovative wishlist feature. Bliss is not just a name; it encapsulates the essence of joy and happiness that music brings. Similar to medicine, which has the power to heal, Bliss aspires to be a remedy for the soul, creating a harmonious and delightful audio experience.

Tools Used:
The development of this project leverages a robust set of tools and technologies. Key components include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, ensuring a responsive and interactive user interface. Additionally, the project includes audio capabilities using HTML5's audio element, to experince  overall music .,we can access the song from categories and from the favourite playlist, we can play our next song or previous as our wish, we have use the progress bar, so we can go to the exact duration of the particular song.

Implementation:
For the navbar, I implemented animations to rotate the logo. The logoname utilizes Webkit animations to dynamically change colors continuously, creating an engaging visual effect. Additionally, I incorporated a dropdown feature for categorizing elements, allowing users to easily select their preferred category. To enhance user experience, I included a favorite option, enabling users to store their favorite playlists.
Moving to the central part of the body, a list of songs is displayed upon clicking the category button. This list provides comprehensive information, including song duration, name, image, play option, and an "add to favorites" feature. Clicking the play option reveals the actual player, initially hidden. Here, users can play, pause, and navigate to the next song. These functionalities contribute to a seamless and enjoyable music playback experience.
The interface comes alive with dynamic animations, enabling users to visualize the playlist of songs seamlessly. Mouse events such as clicks are employed to change the state of the application, facilitating actions like playing or pausing a song and adding a song to the favorite list. The seek bar provides an intuitive way to track the progress of the currently playing song.
